# < Prework Study Guide Webpage >

## Description

My motivation for making this study guide based on my need to organize the information I'm learning in this bootcamp in a way that i can reference easily when needed. I built this project so that I could practice using the different types of code that I am learning in my prework modules. This website allows me to easily reference key information when I need it without having to thumb through the numerous modules in the prework section of this course. In building this I was able to learn how to code basic HTML, CSS, GIT and JavaScript in order to make this website while also notating the information I used to make it.
