          <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, about the webpage.</li>
          <li>Metadata allows the browser to render the page correctly.</li>
          <li>The "style" element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The "base" element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>      
          <li>The "link" element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>      
          <li>The "meta" element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element.</li>
          <li>Child Elements, ex: "li", are elements listed inside another, ex: "ul".</li>
          <li>Parent Elements hold the child elements, see above examples.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li> "element" and "tag" are often used interchangably</li>
          <li>The "a" element stands for Anchor and is used for links</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>External CSS is done by linking the file by using the "link" element placed in the HTML's head section.</li>
          <li>Examples of inline, internal and external style sheets can be found in Module 3.2.3 Create the CSS File.</li>
          <li>The most common method of CSS is by using an external style sheet.</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use. Separation of concerns is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>To understand this better, it is important to know that every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content. This is sometimes referred to as the CSS box model. (example in Module 3.2.3)</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
