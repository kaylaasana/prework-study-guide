        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HyperText Markup Language</li>
          <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, about the webpage.</li>
          <li>Metadata allows the browser to render the page correctly.</li>
          <li>The "style" element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The "base" element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>      
          <li>The "link" element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>      
          <li>The "meta" element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element.</li>
          <li>Child Elements, ex: "li", are elements listed inside another, ex: "ul".</li>
          <li>Parent Elements hold the child elements, see above examples.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li> "element" and "tag" are often used interchangably</li>
          <li>The "a" element stands for Anchor and is used for links</li>
          <li>I can add as many list item elements as I want to the "ul" element.</li>
          <li>Use the H1-6 elements intentionally.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>External CSS is done by linking the file by using the "link" element placed in the HTML's head section.</li>
          <li>Examples of inline, internal and external style sheets can be found in Module 3.2.3 Create the CSS File.</li>
          <li>The most common method of CSS is by using an external style sheet.</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use. Separation of concerns is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>To understand this better, it is important to know that every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content. This is sometimes referred to as the CSS box model. (example in Module 3.2.3)</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Javascript allows us to interact with the webpage</li>
          <li>Javascript is case sensitive</li>
          <li>String is a sequence of text. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks.</li>
          <li>Numbers do not need quotation marks.</li>
          <li>A variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Boolean is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks.</li>
          <li>Array is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference. They are typically used to hold data that is related in some way. Seems to often be marked by square brackets?</li>
          <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types. The array that we will add to our project only contains strings.</li>
          <li>An object can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable. Keep this in mind.</li>
          <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables). Examples: Additon, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division, Assignment(equals), etc.</li>
          <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code.</li>
          <li>Real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response. Ex: The click event.</li>
          <li>Chrome DevTools is an indispensable developer tool that you will use regularly. Access it by right clicking the browser window and selecting "Inspect" or via keyboard commands: Control+Shift+I</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
          <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. Just like its name sounds, when using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy.</li>
